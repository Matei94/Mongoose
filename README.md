Mongoose
========

Mongoose is a mobile app that aims to strengthen the relationship between people. If this sounds too abstract, here is what Mongoose does: the user logs in and looks up for ongoing challenges (as a challenge example: try to go from your room to bathroom without using your legs). Then he can choose to accept that challenge. In order to do that he must upload a photo/video with him doing that challenge (for the previous example: a video with him crawling his way to the bathroom). Once a challenge completed, he shall donate to a related charity foundation (for the previous example: 'Scope: About disability') and nominate 3 of his friends to do the same challenge.

The name
========

We, humans beings, are classified as a social species. But sometimes it seems like we forget this thing, we forget about those of us in need. Inspired by the 'Mangoose Power' TV show where we learned how Mongooses take care of their injured comrades, we put faith that we can remind people that many of us are in need and we have the power to help them.
